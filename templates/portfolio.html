                        Python is a highly versatile programming language that is used in many
                        fields such as Data Science, Web Development, Machine Learning, Internet
                        of Things, Cloud Native Applications, DevOps, and much more. It is a
                        readable, maintainable, and scalable programming language. It is currently
                        used in popular AI frameworks such as TensorFlow (by Google) and PyTorch
                        (by Facebook). Python also works with popular web frameworks such as Django
                        and Flask.

                        The C programming language is often the first code that students learn in
                        university. However, C is much more than that. C and C++ form the foundation
                        of many existing software. C also contributes to the performance of many
                        Artificial Intelligence frameworks and operating systems. C and C++ are well
                        suited for embedded systems that use modern System-on-a-Chip (SoC) technology.
                        The language has a significant role in Internet of Things (IoT) development.

                        Amazon Web Services (AWS) has become one of the most critical cloud providers
                        in the industry. It is imperative to quickly release features that meet market
                        demands. To achieve this, it is necessary to have knowledge of cloud-native
                        applications. These solutions offer many opportunities to improve products and
                        services.
